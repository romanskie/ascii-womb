## Overview

This is a tool entirely written in Clojure to convert your images (png, jpgs etc) into an ascii art. The current stat is still WIP.

## Usage

First copy an image of your choice into the ressources folder and also change the image path in the ```core.clj``` file. You can also find there an option to scale down the image.

Run the ascii-womb tool as follows:

```bash
lein run
```

Check the output in the ```output.txt``` file in the project root.
